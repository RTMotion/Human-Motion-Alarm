# Shell
Obviously it being a motion sensing alarm I have to prepare it to take a beating.
Obviously once the their triggers the alaram he is either run carrying a screaming alarm with him
or drop it and a broken motion sensing alarm isn't going to help anyone.

### Material 1 Wood
At first I was going to try and carve out a wooden shell to protect the components but after awhile of cariving I'm starting to have second thoughts
It seemed like a good idea it is durable enough, can be carved out to any shape I want, Able to shield it from oncoming rain
seems promising.
But, after actually starting it i soon found out that it might take to long to actually shape the wood the way I need it,
plus it can actually be to heavy to sit on luggage, Plus there could be a chance for the components to dislodge from the wood
and actually bounce around in the wood causing more harm.

### MAterial 2 Foam
Second thought would be A foam shell. 
Pros
Easier to shape and cut
