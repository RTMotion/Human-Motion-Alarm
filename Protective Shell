# Shell
Obviously it being a motion sensing alarm I have to prepare it to take a beating.
Obviously once the their triggers the alaram he is either run carrying a screaming alarm with him
or drop it and a broken motion sensing alarm isn't going to help anyone.

### Material 1 Wood
At first I was going to try and carve out a wooden shell to protect the components but after awhile of cariving I'm starting to have second thoughts
It seemed like a good idea it is durable enough, can be carved out to any shape I want, Able to shield it from oncoming rain
seems promising.
But, after actually starting it i soon found out that it might take to long to actually shape the wood the way I need it,
plus it can actually be to heavy to sit on luggage, Plus there could be a chance for the components to dislodge from the wood
and actually bounce around in the wood causing more harm.

### MAterial 2 Foam
Second thought would be A foam shell. 
Pros
Easier to shape and cut
Noticablly softer than wo0d so it can cushion the blow rather than bounce.
Lighter, and could always stick wooden panels to give it more protection.
Easier to stick to luggage.
Can easily cradle the components.
Cons
May have to much give to actually puncture the foam.
If the shell is just foam not water proof so rain is a factor
May be to light with the components inside it.
